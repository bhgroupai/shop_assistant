# Software Design Description — Shop Assistant

Version 0.5 · 2026-09-17 · Status: draft · Implements: shop_assistant_SRS.md v0.4

## 1. Overview

Six stages, one Python module each, every module runnable on its own (NFR-7). Data flows left to right through files on disk; the bot process only reads them.

```

```

### 1.1 Technology
| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.11+ | same as the rest of the repo |
| Telegram, channel history | Telethon **user account** | bots cannot read channel history; session pattern reused from `telegram_digest/tgclient.py` |
| Telegram, customers + owner | Telethon **bot account** (BotFather token) | customers must not talk to a personal account; bot can message the owner; pattern from `telegram_digest/approval.py` |
| LLM | **Ollama** on a GPU server (RTX 5090), model `gemma4:31b` (tool calling), called through the Anthropic SDK's Anthropic-compatible endpoint (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` → Ollama) with `client.beta.messages.tool_runner` | C-2; same agent loop as `telegram_digest/agent.py` |
| Embeddings | **Ollama** `bge-m3` (multilingual, 1024-d) via the `ollama` Python client, same server | C-2; covers uz-Latin / uz-Cyrillic / ru |
| Reaching Ollama | On the same LAN `http://<gpu-host>:11434`; elsewhere `ssh -N -L 11434:localhost:11434 <gpu-host>` then `http://localhost:11434`; on the server itself `localhost` | no auth on the API — never expose it publicly |
| Vector store | `numpy` array + cosine similarity | ≤ a few thousand posts; a DB adds nothing to learn yet |
| Storage | JSONL files under `data/` | greppable, diffable, restart-safe (FR-6) |
| Secrets | `.env` via `python-dotenv` | NFR-6 |
| Deploy | rsync + user-level systemd, copy of `telegram_digest/deploy.sh` | NFR-5, C-3 |

## 2. Data Model

All files live in `shop_assistant/data/` (gitignored). One JSON object per line.

### 2.1 `posts.jsonl` — raw, written by fetch.py
```json
{"id": 1234, "date": "2026-09-10T14:02:00", "link": "https://t.me/example_shop/1234",
 "caption": "🍂Kuz mavsumi uchun🍂\n🔥Yangi model Dvoyka🔥\nRazmer:M.L.XL.2XL.3XL\nNarx:980.000ming\n...",
 "has_media": true}
```

### 2.2 `products.jsonl` — one record per post, written by extract.py
```json
{"id": 1234, "date": "2026-09-10", "link": "https://t.me/example_shop/1234",
 "name": "Dvoyka", "category": "kiyim",
 "price": 980000, "subscriber_price": null,
 "sizes": ["M","L","XL","2XL","3XL"], "colors": [],
 "keywords": ["dvoyka","двойка","костюм двойка","two-piece set","sport kostyum"],
 "season": "kuz", "body": "Yangi model Dvoyka Razmer M L XL 2XL 3XL"}
```
- `category` ∈ fixed list: `kiyim`, `poyabzal`, `aksessuar`, `boshqa` (extend when the channel shows more).
- `body` = caption with footer (FR-3a) and emoji stripped; this is the text that gets embedded.
- `keywords` are produced by the LLM in four scripts/languages (FR-4) and stored already **normalised** (§4.2).

### 2.3 `embeddings.npy` + `embeddings_ids.json`
`float32[N, D]` matrix, row *i* belongs to post `ids[i]`. Both rewritten together by index.py.

### 2.4 `faq.jsonl` — owner answers, appended by bot.py (FR-22)
```json
{"ts": "...", "question": "dastavka Samarqandga qancha?", "answer": "35 ming, 2 kun", "post_ids": [1234]}
```
FAQ entries are embedded too (separate `faq_embeddings.npy`), so `search_faq` is semantic.

### 2.5 `state.json`
`{"last_post_id": 1234, "last_index_at": "..."}` — drives incremental ingestion (FR-7) and `/stats` (FR-26).

### 2.6 `log.jsonl` — one line per customer turn (FR-25)
`{"ts", "chat_id", "question", "tools": [{"name", "input", "n_results"}], "answer", "escalated": bool, "ms", "usd", "llm_calls": int}`
(`llm_calls` = Gemini requests that turn, LLM + query embeddings; older lines without it count 1.)

## 3. Components

### 3.1 `fetch.py` — FR-1, FR-2, FR-3, FR-7
- `fetch(channel, min_id, limit=500) -> list[Post]` via `tg.iter_messages(channel, min_id=min_id, limit=limit)`.
- Skip empty captions. Dedup on `normalise(caption)` keeping the newest id.
- Append to `posts.jsonl`, update `state.last_post_id`.
- CLI: `python -m shop_assistant.fetch [--full]`.

### 3.2 `extract.py` — FR-3a, FR-3b, FR-4
- `strip_footer(caption) -> body`: drop lines matching phone / `@handle` / `📍` / delivery boilerplate; strip emoji.
- `extract(body) -> Product` — one LLM call (Ollama, `config.MODEL`) with a JSON schema (tool-use with a single `record_product` tool, forced) so the output is always valid. Prompt gives the fixed category list, price notation examples (`980.000ming` → 980000), and asks for keywords in uz-Latin, uz-Cyrillic, ru, en.
- Batches of 10 posts per call to keep NFR-3. `max_tokens ≥ 1000`: `gemma4:31b` emits a `thinking` block before the `tool_use` block; with 200 tokens the call is cut off before the tool call (spike #3).
- CLI: `python -m shop_assistant.extract` processes posts not yet in `products.jsonl`.

### 3.3 `index.py` — FR-5, FR-6
- `embed(texts: list[str]) -> np.ndarray` — Ollama `/api/embed` with `config.EMBED_MODEL`, batches of `config.EMBED_BATCH`; `bge-m3` needs no query/document prefix.
- **Embed the normalised text**: `embed([normalise(product_text(p)) …])`. Spike #3 measured `bge-m3` cross-script raw at 0.62–0.67 (`krossovka`/`кроссовка`) but 0.87 after transliteration — so D-3 applies to embeddings too, not only to keywords.
- Embeds `name + " " + body + " " + " ".join(keywords)` per product; rewrites `embeddings.npy` / `embeddings_ids.json` for all products (cheap at this size; simpler than patching rows).
- Same for `faq.jsonl` → `faq_embeddings.npy`.
- CLI: `python -m shop_assistant.index`.

### 3.4 `textnorm.py` — FR-9
- `normalise(s) -> str`: lowercase → Cyrillic→Latin transliteration table (uz + ru letters) → `oʻ o' o` / `gʻ g' g` / `ў o` / `ғ g` / `ҳ h` / `қ q` folded → collapse whitespace.
- Used on keywords at extract time and on customer filter values at search time, so `krossovka`, `кроссовка`, `Krossovka` all match.

### 3.5 `search.py` — FR-8, FR-10, FR-11, FR-12
```python
def find_products(category=None, min_price=None, max_price=None, size=None, color=None, keywords=None, limit=5) -> list[Product]
def semantic_search(text, max_price=None, limit=5) -> list[Product]     # embed(normalise(text)), cosine, then price filter
def latest_posts(n=5) -> list[Product]
def search_faq(text, limit=3) -> list[FaqEntry]
```
- Filters are ANDed; `keywords` matches if **any** normalised customer keyword is a substring of any normalised product keyword or of `normalise(name)`.
- Every returned product carries `link`, `date`, and `stale: bool` (`date` older than `config.STALE_DAYS = 60`, FR-16).
- Loads `products.jsonl` + `.npy` once at import; `reload()` for the admin re-index command.
- CLI: `python -m shop_assistant.search "krosovka 42"` prints both filter and semantic results (FR-24).

### 3.6 `tools.py` — the agent's interface
Thin `@beta_tool` wrappers around §3.5 that return compact text (one line per product: `name · price · sizes · date · link · [eskirgan]`), plus:
- `ask_owner(question: str, post_ids: list[int]) -> str` — calls `bot.escalate(...)` through `run_coroutine_threadsafe` (same thread-bridge as `tgclient.run`). Returns `"forwarded"`.

### 3.7 `agent.py` — FR-13…FR-18, FR-20
- `run_agent(chat_id, text) -> str`, blocking, run in a worker thread.
- Per-customer history: `dict[chat_id, list[message]]`, last 10 turns, in memory only (FR-17, NFR-4).
- System prompt (rules, kept short):
  1. Answer in the customer's language and script.
  2. First `find_products`; if empty and the question has a descriptive part, `semantic_search`. For delivery/payment/other shop questions, `search_faq`.
  3. Never state price, size or availability not in tool output. Never guess stock.
  4. Escalate with `ask_owner` when: stock/availability asked, nothing relevant found, or question is outside the catalog.
  5. Max 5 products per reply; if more, ask the customer to narrow down. Always include links. Mark stale posts with the "may be sold out" note.
- `max_iterations=8`, `max_tokens=1024`, model `config.MODEL` = `gemma4:31b` (NFR-1/NFR-2; switch to `qwen2.5:32b` only if the eval demands it).

### 3.8 `bot.py` — FR-19, FR-21, FR-22, FR-26, C-5
- One Telethon bot client. Handlers:
  - `NewMessage(incoming, is_private, sender != owner)` → `asyncio.to_thread(run_agent, chat_id, text)` → reply. Groups are ignored (C-5).
  - **Carousel reply (S4, #19).** When the agent's text names posts, the customer gets ONE message: item 1's photo/video (the channel logo when the post has none), a card caption (`N. name` / `Narxi:` / `O'lcham:` / `Sana:` / stale warning) and inline buttons `◀ · N/n · ▶`, `Narxini so'rash` (only when the item has no price → `escalate` with that post id), `Kanalda ko'rish`. `CallbackQuery` edits the message in place; callback data `c:<idx>:<ids>` is self-contained (≤ 64 bytes) so navigation survives restarts. Text-only fallback (no link preview) when the send fails. The agent's numbered text still carries every link (FR-11/FR-14, eval parses ids) — it is the caption source, not shown as a list.
  - `escalate(customer_id, question, post_ids)` → message to `TG_OWNER_ID`: `"#esc <customer_id>\n<question>\n<links>"`. Tells the customer "Egasi tez orada javob beradi".
  - `NewMessage` from owner **that is a reply** to an `#esc` message → parse `customer_id` from the quoted text → forward owner's text to the customer → append to `faq.jsonl` → `index.reindex_faq()`.
  - `/stats` from owner only → counts from `state.json` and today's `log.jsonl`.
- Logs every turn to `log.jsonl` (FR-25).

### 3.9 `config.py`
`CHANNEL` (from env `TG_CHANNEL`, the shop channel username without @), `STALE_DAYS = 60`, `MAX_RESULTS = 5`, `CATEGORIES = [...]`, `FETCH_LIMIT = 500`, model names (`MODEL = "gemma4:31b"`, `EMBED_MODEL = "bge-m3"`), paths. From env: `TG_CHANNEL`, `TG_API_ID`, `TG_API_HASH`, `TG_BOT_TOKEN`, `TG_OWNER_ID`, `OLLAMA_URL` (default `http://localhost:11434`). The Anthropic SDK is pointed at Ollama by setting `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL = OLLAMA_URL` and a dummy `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

### 3.10 `main.py`
Loads `.env`, starts the bot, runs forever. Ingestion is **not** in the service: admin runs `fetch → extract → index` by hand or cron (FR-23), then sends `/reindex` to the bot (calls `search.reload()`).

## 4. Key Design Decisions

| # | Decision | Alternative rejected | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | Filters first, embeddings as fallback | embeddings only | numbers (size 42, ≤ 200k) embed badly; also the teaching point of the project |
| D-2 | Structured extraction with forced tool-use JSON | regex on captions | template drifts; the LLM handles "980.000ming", "Telegram obunachilariga narx", missing lines |
| D-3 | Normalise scripts at index *and* query time — for keywords **and** for the text that gets embedded | fuzzy matching at query time; raw-text embeddings | one cheap deterministic function, testable in isolation; spike #3: `bge-m3` cross-script similarity 0.62 raw → 0.87 normalised |
| D-4 | Rewrite the whole embedding matrix on index | patch rows | N is small; correctness over cleverness |
| D-5 | Owner replies via Telegram "reply to" the escalation message | inline buttons / commands | zero UI to build; the quoted `#esc <id>` header carries the routing |
| D-6 | Conversation history in memory only | persist per customer | NFR-4 privacy; restart loses only the current chat context |
| D-8 | Customer replies are a one-message carousel with inline buttons (2026-09-21) | forward the channel posts / send an album / plain text list | forwards and albums made customers scroll through five screens; an album cannot carry buttons; Telegram's native "Show as carousel" is app-only until a Bot API layer exposes it |
| D-9 | `boshqa` records stay in `products.jsonl` but are never returned by search (`search.is_sellable`) | drop them at extraction | ids stay stable for the eval; announcements are visible for debugging |
| D-7 | Ingestion outside the bot process | live `on_channel_post` handler | keeps the service simple; live updates are a v2 item |

## 5. Module Layout

```
shop_assistant/                   # repo root; run everything from here
  docs/shop_assistant_SRS.md, shop_assistant_SDD.md
  shop_assistant/                 # the package: `python -m shop_assistant.fetch`
    config.py  models.py  textnorm.py  fetch.py  extract.py  index.py  search.py
    tools.py   agent.py   bot.py      main.py
  eval/questions.jsonl        # 20 questions, expected: {"posts":[ids]} or {"escalate":true}
  eval/run_eval.py            # runs agent offline (ask_owner stubbed), prints AC-2..AC-4
  tests/                      # only tests for merged work; a ticket's tests live on its branch until merged
  .github/                    # CI (pytest + tests/ untouched check), CODEOWNERS, PR template
  data/  session/             # gitignored
  requirements.txt  .env.example  deploy.sh  shop-assistant.service
```

## 6. Traceability

| Requirement | Component |
|---|---|
| FR-1, 2, 3, 7 | fetch.py |
| FR-3a, 3b, 4 | extract.py |
| FR-5, 6 | index.py |
| FR-8, 9, 10, 11, 12 | search.py, textnorm.py |
| FR-13–18, 20 | agent.py (system prompt + history) |
| FR-19, 21, 22 | bot.py `escalate` + owner-reply handler, tools.ask_owner |
| FR-23, 24 | CLIs of fetch/extract/index/search |
| FR-25, 26 | bot.py logging, `/stats` |
| NFR-1, 2 | Sonnet, max_iterations=8, compact tool output |
| NFR-3 | extract batching (10/call), embed batching (128) |
| NFR-4 | in-memory history, log stores question text only |
| NFR-5 | systemd `Restart=always` |
| NFR-6 | `.env`, `data/` and `session/` gitignored |
| NFR-7 | one module per stage, each with `__main__` |
| AC-1–4 | eval/ |
| AC-5 | manual test with owner account |
| AC-6 | restart service, confirm `search.py` loads from disk without network |

## 7. Risks
- Ollama swaps models on demand and only one ~19 GB model fits the GPU at a time: alternating `gemma4:31b` and `bge-m3` calls costs seconds per swap → ingestion embeds in one pass after extraction; the bot calls embed only on the semantic fallback.
- `gemma4:31b` tool calling through the Anthropic-compatible endpoint (forced `tool_choice`) is unverified → ticket #3 spike checks it before #5/#10.
- Deploy target is the GPU server itself so Ollama is `localhost`.
- Category list too narrow → `boshqa` bucket; review after first extract run.
- Customer sends a photo/voice only → agent gets `<media>`; reply asking for text (v1), photo search is out of scope.
- Owner forgets to *reply* to the `#esc` message → bot answers the owner with a hint.

## 8. Change Log
| Version | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | 2026-09-16 | Initial design against SRS v0.3 |
| 0.2 | 2026-09-16 | §5: code lives in a `shop_assistant/` package (so `python -m shop_assistant.x` works from repo root); `models.py` holds Post/Product/FaqEntry; scaffolding for tickets 1–15 |
| 0.3 | 2026-09-17 | §5: tests per ticket live on the ticket branch (senior-written), `main` keeps only merged tests; CI added |
| 0.5 | 2026-09-17 | Spike #3 results: embed normalised text (§3.3, §3.5, D-3); `max_tokens ≥ 1000` for extraction (§3.2) |
| 0.6 | 2026-09-21 | S4: §3.8 carousel reply (D-8); §3.2 product names = type + brand (`product_name` guard) and announcements → `boshqa` (`is_announcement`); §3.5 search excludes `boshqa` (D-9); tools number results, `narxi: so'rab beraman` + offer line (#21) |
| 0.7 | 2026-09-23 | #17: owner `/stats` (indexed posts, last index, questions/escalations today, `Gemini: N / GEMINI_DAILY_LIMIT today` from `log.jsonl` + `gemini_ingest.jsonl`) and `/reindex` (`search.reload()`); §2.6 `log.jsonl` gains `llm_calls`; `run()` dispatches through `bot.route` |
| 0.4 | 2026-09-17 | SRS C-2 v0.4: Claude + Voyage replaced by Ollama on the GPU server (`gemma4:31b`, `bge-m3`); §1.1, §3.2, §3.3, §3.7, §3.9, §7 updated; deploy target = the GPU server |
