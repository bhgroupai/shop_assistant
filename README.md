# Shop Assistant

Telegram bot that answers customers' "do you have …?" questions about a shop whose catalog is the posts of a Telegram channel (set `TG_CHANNEL` in `.env`). Filters first, embeddings as fallback, escalates to the owner when unsure. Built from scratch — no agent/RAG frameworks.

- Requirements: `docs/shop_assistant_SRS.md`
- Design: `docs/shop_assistant_SDD.md`
- Backlog: Notion board (ids in `.claude/skills/shop-assistant-board/`)
