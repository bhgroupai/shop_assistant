name: shop-assistant-board
description: Use when working in the shop_assistant repo and the user asks "what's next", "what should I do now", "show the board", "mark ticket X done", "what's left for MVP", or wants to add/re-order tickets. Holds the Notion board ids, schema, ready-made queries and the planning decisions behind the Shop Assistant sprint board so a later session does not undo them.

# Shop Assistant — sprint board

The backlog for `shop_assistant/` lives in Notion. Follow `Order` top to bottom and you are always unblocked.

## Schema

`Name` title · `Order` number (dependency sequence, primary sort) · `Sprint` S1/S2/S3/R2 backlog · `Release` MVP/R2 · `Status` To Do/In Progress/Done · `Epic` E1 Setup/E2 Ingest/E3 Search/E4 Agent/E5 Bot/E6 Eval & Deploy · `Est (days)` · `Req` FR/NFR/AC ids · `Blocks` plain words · `Description` one line · `Owner` Sanjar/Abdurauf/Artur (juniors; **Sanjar ≠ Sanjarbek** — Sanjarbek is the user/senior who writes tests and reviews) · `Track` A Search/B Ingest/C Agent/Bot.

Ticket body (junior-ready, since 2026-09-16): `## Scope` (Goal, Needs, Files you touch) · `## Steps` (numbered, each with a command + expected output; describe the approach in prose — library, function names, key params, docs to read — **never paste implementation code**; juniors have no access to `telegram_digest`) · `## Acceptance criteria` · `## Prompt for your agent` (paste-ready) · `## Notes / Watch out`. Shared rules live in `docs/WORKFLOW.md` in the repo. New tickets must follow this body.

## Queries (`notion-query-data-sources`, SQL mode, table = the data source url)

What's next:
```sql
SELECT "Order", "Name", "Epic", "Est (days)", "Req" FROM "collection://c386dd00-19e7-4a53-9944-9b692e9a89da"
WHERE "Release" = 'MVP' AND "Status" != 'Done' ORDER BY "Order" LIMIT 3
```
What's next for one person: add `AND "Owner" = 'Artur'`.
MVP progress:
```sql
SELECT "Status", COUNT(*) n, SUM("Est (days)") days FROM "collection://c386dd00-19e7-4a53-9944-9b692e9a89da"
WHERE "Release" = 'MVP' GROUP BY "Status"
```
Mark done: `notion-update-page` with `command: update_properties`, `properties: {"Status": "Done"}` on the ticket page id (get it from `SELECT url, "Name" … WHERE "Order" = N`).

Insert a ticket between 7 and 8: create with `Order` 7.5 — never renumber the rest.

## Decisions behind the plan (do not undo silently)

- **Order 2 is the gating ticket** — Product schema + `textnorm` are frozen first because extract, index, search and eval fixtures all depend on them; changing later means re-extracting every post.
- **Local models only (SRS C-2 v0.4, 2026-09-17)** — Ollama on the Codeschool GPU server (`gemma4:31b` for LLM/tool calling, `bge-m3` for embeddings), reached via LAN `192.168.0.218:11434` or ssh tunnel; Anthropic SDK pointed at it by `config.py`. No Claude/Voyage keys anywhere. Deploy target = Codeschool. Server details: servers-docs skill → Codeschool Server/ai/ollama.md.
- **Order 3 (Ollama spike) sits before any code that uses the models** — verifies cross-script similarity (D-3) and forced `tool_choice` through Ollama's Anthropic-compatible endpoint (D-2). `bge-m3` must be pulled on the server first. If either fails, revisit SDD before tickets 5/8/10.
- **Filters first, semantic fallback** (SDD D-1) — tickets 7 then 8, in that order; the misses from 7 become the semantic-only eval questions in 11.
- **Eval questions (11) are written before agent.py (10) is finished** — otherwise they get biased toward what already passes.
- **R2 = FR-22 FAQ store, FR-26 /stats + /reindex, cron ingestion** — the user agreed on 2026-09-16 to defer them; MVP must still pass AC-1…AC-6 without them.
- **Three juniors since 2026-09-16, each with an AI agent** — `Owner` + `Track` columns. Tracks run in parallel because every module exists as a stub with SDD signatures (commit `fad4eb4`):
  - A Search — Sanjar: 2 → 7 → 8 → 9
  - B Ingest — Abdurauf: 3 → 4 → 5 → 6
  - C Agent/Bot — Artur: 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 (10 starts against stubs; 12 needs 7/8 + data)
  Cross-track handoffs written into the tickets: #13 needs `agent.last_run` from #10; #9 adds a one-line `escalate_sync` stub to bot.py for #14.
- **Test flow (decided 2026-09-17, user's deliberate choice — not the mainstream "implementer writes tests"):** a senior writes a ticket's tests on branch `t<N>-<name>` (pushed to origin), assigns it; the junior implements on that branch and never edits `tests/`; PR to `main`; CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: pytest + a job that fails if `tests/` changed without label `tests-by-senior`) + senior review; merge. `main` holds tests only for merged work — **no pre-written suite on main, no xfail markers**. **Branch is created at hand-out time** (decided 2026-09-17): when a ticket moves to In Progress — and only when its dependencies are Done — cut `t<N>-<name>` from current `main`, add that ticket's test file, push, tell the junior. Never pre-create branches (they go stale and need rebasing, which forces juniors to reset). Prepared test files live in the session scratchpad `tests/` (test_extract, test_index, test_search_semantic, test_tools, test_agent, test_eval, test_bot, test_bot_escalation) — regenerate from the ticket's acceptance criteria if lost. #3/#11/#15 have no tests; junior creates the branch. Rules for juniors: `docs/WORKFLOW.md`.
- **Planned evolution:** once juniors are trusted, senior writes 2–3 acceptance tests and juniors add unit tests in the PR. Don't propose it before the user asks.
- **Ticket 1 is Done** (scaffolding commit).
- **Branch protection on `main`** (PR required, CI checks `tests` + `tests-untouched`, 1 approval) must be set in the GitHub UI — `gh` is not installed on this machine.

## When a ticket is finished

1. Set `Status = Done` in Notion.
2. If the work changed a requirement or design decision, update the repo doc (SRS/SDD change log) first, then the Notion digest page.
3. Run the "What's next" query and tell the user the next ticket's name, estimate and its *Notes / Watch out* section.
